Connect tables by their keys using JOINS

Think of "Joining tables" as creating a bigger/mega/huge table of data.
Joining tables (almost) always has a multiplying effect on the overall number of rows in the resulting data set.

-- Inner Join: Data must exist in both of the joined tables.
-- Outer Join: Data only has to exist in one of the joined tables

--Outer Joins Exercise
USE [A01-School]

--2. Select the Position Description and the count of how many staff are in those positions. Return the count for ALL positions.
--HINT: Count can use either count(*) which means records or a field name. Which gives the correct result in this question?
